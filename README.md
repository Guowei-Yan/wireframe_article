# Introduction

This project is for Front-end Technical test from Guowei Yan. The project is created based on React-App. In this project, I have used Typescript, React and Bootstrap as required. Thanks for your time and I will continue update this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will help users install all modules required

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Known Bugs for now`

The fifth version has know bugs:
* The cards in same line don't align because I have not created cards lines div yet. It will be fixed shortly.
* It's flashing since I used setInverval and redux store to check how many cards should have 

### `Update`

This repo will be updated regularly. Very welcome for any comments and bugs reporting.
